1. Download and Install Android Studio - http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
2. Download the Android SDK versions you want to develop and test for by selecting Tools->Android->SDK Manager.  This project has a minimum level of Android 4.4 (API 19 - KitKat)
3. From within Android Studio, create a new project by selecting File->New->Project From Version Control->Github

After the project is created within Android Studio, plug in your device via USB and you should be able to run the "app" configuration with the play toolbar button.  This will download, install, and run the application.

If you have issues connecting to the device, make sure you've installed the device manufacturer's USB drivers.
